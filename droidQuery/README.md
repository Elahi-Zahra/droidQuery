## droidQuery

---------------------

__droidQuery__ is an Android *port* of [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). It is meant to simplify View hierarchies, 
attributes, and animations, as well as common tasks, such as Dialogs and Asynchronous tasks. It does not allow one to write 
JavaScript, and does not write web code. Instead, this is a Java Android library with similar syntax and shortcuts to those that
are provided by *jQuery*.

Until I get more up here, check out the sample application, and the extensions I provided as other projects.
